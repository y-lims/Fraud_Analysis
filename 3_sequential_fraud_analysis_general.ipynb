    "# Sequential Workflow Analysis for General Split Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the complete sequential fraud detection workflow using models trained on general split data (random train/validation/test split). The workflow combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest to identify potential fraud cases\n",
    "2. **Classification**: Various AutoML models (AutoGluon, FLAML, H2O, XGBoost, CatBoost) to classify flagged anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the timebased split approach, the general split uses random sampling which allows for better representation of patterns across different time periods but may not reflect real-world temporal deployment scenarios."
